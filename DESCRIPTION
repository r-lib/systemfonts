Description: Provides system native access to the font catalogue. As font
    handling varies between systems it is difficult to correctly locate 
    installed fonts across different operating systems. The 'systemfonts' 
    package provides bindings to the native libraries on Windows, macOS and 
    Linux for finding font files that can then be used further by e.g. graphic
    devices. The main use is intended to be from compiled code but 'systemfonts'
    also provides access from R.
