Description: Provides system native access to the font catalogue. As font
    handling varies between systems it is difficult to correctly locate
    installed fonts across different operating systems. The 'systemfonts'
    package provides bindings to the native libraries on Windows, macOS
    and Linux for finding font files that can then be used further by e.g.
    graphic devices. The main use is intended to be from compiled code but
    'systemfonts' also provides access from R.
